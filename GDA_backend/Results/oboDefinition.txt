Preaxial polydactyly, i.e., polydactyly on the radial side of the hand, is a heterogeneous category. Four types are: (1) thumb polydactyly, (2) polydactyly of triphalangeal thumb, (3) polydactyly of index finger, and (4) polysyndactyly. Preaxial polydactyly I (PPD1), 'thumb polydactyly,' involves duplication of 1 or more of the skeletal components of a biphalangeal thumb. Severity varies from mere broadening of the distal phalanx with slight bifurcation at the tip to full duplication of the thumb including the metacarpals. This type is the most frequent form of polydactyly in many populations. PPD1 is caused by homozygous mutation in the GLI1 gene on chromosome 12q13. (OMIM)

In rare cases, vascular malformations can result from trauma or diseases.
Neurodevelopmental disorder with central and peripheral motor dysfunction (NEDCPMD) is an autosomal recessive neurologic disorder with a highly variable phenotype. At the severe end of the spectrum, patients may have hypotonia apparent from birth, necessitating mechanical respiration and tube-feeding, and global developmental delay with absence of reaction to touch and no eye contact. At the mild end of the spectrum, patients may present with infantile-onset progressive ataxia and demyelinating peripheral neuropathy. The disorder is caused by mutation in the NFASC gene, which has several neuronal- and glial-specific transcripts. The variable clinical phenotype may be caused by several factors, including the severity of the mutation, the selective involvement of distinct isoforms by pathogenic variants, and the presence of genetic modifiers. NEDCPMD is caused by homozygous mutation in the NFASC gene on chromosome 1q32. (OMIM)

Although both preaxial polydactyly and syndactyly are cardinal features of this malformation, it is classified as a form of polydactyly because syndactyly does not occur in the absence of polydactyly, the opposite not being true. On the other hand, polysyndactyly is here classified as a type of syndactyly because polydactyly (of the third or fourth fingers and fifth toes) does not occur in the absence of syndactyly. The thumb shows only the mildest degree of duplication, and syndactyly of various degrees affects fingers 3 and 4. The foot malformation is more constant and consists of duplication of part or all of the first or second toes and syndactyly affects all of the toes, especially the second and third.

Porokeratosis is a rare skin disorder characterized by one or more annular plaques with a surrounding raised horny border that spreads centrifugally. Variants of porokeratosis have been described that differ in morphologic shapes, distribution, and clinical course. However, reports of several families with expression of more than one variant of porokeratosis among members, and of individuals expressing more than one variant, suggest that the distinctions among these variants may be artificial. Disseminated superficial actinic porokeratosis (DSAP) is the most common subtype of porokeratosis. It is characterized by multiple small, annular, anhidrotic, keratotic lesions that are located predominantly on sun-exposed areas of the skin, such as the face, neck, and distal limbs. The lesions typically begin to develop in adolescence and reach near-complete penetrance by the third or fourth decade of life. POROK6 maps to chromosome 1p31. (OMIM)

Porokeratosis is a rare skin disorder characterized by one or more annular plaques with a surrounding raised horny border that spreads centrifugally. Variants of porokeratosis have been described that differ in morphologic shape, distribution, and clinical course (Schamroth et al., 1997). However, as noted by Sybert (2010), the existence of several families with expression of more than one variant of porokeratosis among members, and individuals expressing more than one variant, suggest that the distinctions among these variants may be artificial. Disseminated superficial actinic porokeratosis (DSAP) is the most common subtype of porokeratosis. It is characterized by multiple small, annular, anhidrotic, keratotic lesions that are located predominantly on sun-exposed areas of the skin, such as the face, neck, and distal limbs. The lesions typically begin to develop in adolescence and reach near-complete penetrance by the third or fourth decade of life.

Subcutaneous panniculitis-like T-cell lymphoma (SPTCL) is an uncommon form of T-cell non-Hodgkin lymphoma in which cytotoxic CD8+ T cells infiltrate adipose tissue forming subcutaneous nodules. Both children and adults can be affected, with a median age at diagnosis of 36 years and a female gender bias. Most patients have accompanying systemic features such as fever or flank pain. A subset (about 20%) of patients develop hemophagocytic lymphohistiocytosis (HLH), usually associated with CD8+ T cells rimming adipocytes in the bone marrow. An infectious agent is not identified, and the disorder is believed to result from improperly activated inflammation. Immunosuppressive therapy may be helpful; hematopoietic bone marrow transplantation is usually curative.
